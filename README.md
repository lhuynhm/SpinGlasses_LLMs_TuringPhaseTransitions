Code and Data for "(Un)biased data and spin glasses reveal clustering for Turing phase transitions within human-transformer interactions" by Jackson George, Zachariah Yusaf, Stephanie Zoltick, Linh Huynh (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02879). All authors contributed equally to this work, with J.G., Z.Y., S.Z. being undergraduate students and co-first authors, and L.H. being the research mentor and senior author.

Contribution Statement:

Linh Huynh designed and supervised the project. All authors collected data.

********** Code and Figure Results in the September 10, 2025 Draft (Version 2):

Stephanie Zoltick: Figure 1(A) and (B) â€” but Linh Huynh added the bias quantification idea in Version 2 (it wasn't there in Version 1), Figure 2(A) and (B)

Jackson George: Figure 2(C) and (D), Figure 4, Figures B1 and B2 in the Appendix

Linh Huynh: Figure 3 and Figure 5

Zach Yusaf: helped revise the aesthetics of Stephanie's figures, also tried to reproduce the results in another paper but we didn't include that in our paper.

********** Writing:

Version 1 (May 4, 2025):

All the 4 of us: Introduction and Discussion; Stephanie Zoltick: Statistical analysis; Jackson George: Cosine similarity analysis; Zach Yusaf: Experimental design and data collection; Linh Huynh: Spin glass model and simulation

Version 2 (September 10, 2025): Linh Huynh

We stopped meeting after May 4, 2025 and Linh Huynh re-wrote the whole draft during summer 2025. We met again on September 10, 2025 to finalize the draft and submit it.
